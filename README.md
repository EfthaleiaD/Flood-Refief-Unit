# Flood-Refief-Unit
The Flood Relief Unit is an autonomous, GPS-equipped boat system developed to assist fire departments in delivering food and essential supplies to communities isolated by flooding. With a single button press, the unit sets off, notifying both the fire department and recipients about its journey and expected arrival time. It transmits real-time location updates throughout the trip, allowing emergency teams to monitor its progress and respond quickly if issues arise. Designed to operate in challenging, flood-affected areas, this innovative solution ensures a steady supply of essentials, providing critical support and reliable aid to those in need.
